**What is Multiple Linear Regression?**

Multiple regression is a statistical method that aims to predict a
dependent variable using multiple independent variables. It is generally
used to find the relationship between several independent variables and
a dependent variable.

The formula for Multiple regression model is:

Y = β0 + β1 X2 + β2 X2 +… + βn Xn + e

Where,

Y: Dependent variable or response

X: Independent variable or predictor

α: Constant

β: Coefficient Estimate

**What Is The Advantage Of The Multiple Regression?**

The advantage of multiple regression with this technique is that it
gives an opportunity for the individual to study the pattern of these
factors and finally able to understand and study the influence of each
and every variable which incorporates the yield

The F test is to see whether the independent variables together
(simultaneously) have a significant effect on the dependent variable.

Hypothesis :

H0 = there is no simultaneous influence from variable (X) to the
dependent variable (Y)

H1 = there is a simultaneous influence of the independent variable (X)
on the dependent variable (Y)

Acceptance Criteria :

accept H0 if the value of Fcount ≤F table

reject H0 if the value of Fcount&gt; Ftable

The t-test is used to determine the effect of each independent variable
on the dependent variable

Hypothesis :

H0 = there is no partial influence of the independent variable (X) on
the dependent variable (Y)

H1 = there is a partial effect of the independent variable (X) on the
dependent variable (Y)

Hypothesis Acceptance Criteria :

accept H0 if tcount ≤ ttable

reject H0 if tcount&gt; ttable
